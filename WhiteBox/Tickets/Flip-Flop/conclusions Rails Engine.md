We've drawn several key conclusions related with the creation of a custom Rails Engine using Flip-Flop or Flipper.

Creating a Rails engine to handle feature flag logic offers effective encapsulation. This means that all functionality related to feature flags is kept in one place, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

A Rails engine also allows for code reuse across our multiple Rails applications. If several applications within the organization need to use feature flags, a Rails engine provides an efficient and consistent solution.

Furthermore, creating a Rails engine allows for deeper customization of the feature flag gem. This could include adding additional functionalities, such as the ability to enable or disable features for a specific percentage of users. (despite this functionality is included by default on the Flipper gem)

A Rails engine can also make the code easier to test. Tests can be written for the engine independently from the rest of the application, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.

Finally, having the feature flag logic in a separate engine reduces coupling in the application. This means that changes to the feature flag logic will not affect the rest of the application, which can facilitate the maintainability and scalability of the application.

While creating a Rails engine may require some initial effort, the long-term benefits in terms of maintainability, code reuse, customization, and ease of testing are significant.
