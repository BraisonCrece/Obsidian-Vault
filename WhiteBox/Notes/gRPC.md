<span style='color:#3867d6'>gRPC</span> is a **high-performance Remote Procedure Call** (RPC) framework developed by Google. It is used to develop scalable and distributed services. These are the key features and concepts you should know as a software engineer:

1. **Protocol Buffers (ProtoBuf)**: 
   - They are the serialization/deserialization format used by gRPC. They are <span style='color:#fa8231'>more efficient in terms of size and speed than other popular formats such as JSON or XML</span>.
   - A `.proto` file is defined that specifies the structure of messages and services.

2. **Service Definition Interface (SDI)**:
   - Defines the methods that can be called remotely and their arguments using `.proto` files.

3. **Multiplexed Transmission**:
   - gRPC uses HTTP/2, which allows it to <span style='color:#fa8231'>handle multiple requests and responses on a single connection</span>, reducing latency and increasing performance.

4. **Streaming**:
   - gRPC supports both client-to-server (client streaming) and server-to-client (server streaming) or<span style='color:#fa8231'> bidirectional streaming</span>. This is useful for real-time data transmission scenarios.

5. **Authentication:
   - Can use <span style='color:#fa8231'>SSL/TLS</span> for authentication and encryption in transit. It also supports token-based authentication such as <span style='color:#fa8231'>JWT</span>.

6. **Interoperability**:
   - Although gRPC and Protocol Buffers are designed to work together, they can be used separately. gRPC is serialization format agnostic, and ProtoBuf can be used without gRPC.

7. **Client libraries**:
   - gRPC provides client libraries for several languages, including C++, Java, Python, Go, among others.

8. **Pluggable**: 
   - gRPC is designed to support <span style='color:#fa8231'>plug-ins</span> for authentication, load balancing, retries and other aspects of network behavior.

9. **Deadlines/Timeouts**: 
   - gRPC allows you to <span style='color:#fa8231'>specify how long a client should wait for a response</span>. The server can check this and decide whether to continue processing or abort if it is likely to miss the deadline.

10. **Cancellation**:
   - If a client does not need the result of a call, it can cancel it. The server receives a notification and can <span style='color:#fa8231'>save resources by canceling the related job</span>.

11. **Control flow**:
   - A feature of HTTP/2 that prevents a sender from overrunning the receiver's buffers, which could lead to inefficient use of bandwidth and other resources.

12. **Error Handling**:
   - gRPC allows rich error representation using status codes.

13. **Load Balancing**:
   - gRPC supports<span style='color:#fa8231'> load balancing </span>through different strategies.

**Basic steps to get started with gRPC**:

1. Define your service and messages using Protocol Buffers in a `.proto` file.
2. Use the Protocol Buffers compiler (`.protoc`) to generate client and server code in the language of your choice.
3. Implement the server using the generated interface.
4. Implement the client using generated stubs.
5. Runs the server, makes RPC calls from the client.

**Additional considerations:
- Although gRPC has many advantages, it is not always the best choice for all scenarios. For example, for web applications where the browser must make API calls, REST/JSON may be more suitable due to native browser support.
- The debugging and monitoring tools for gRPC might not be as mature or extensive as those for REST.

Finally, I would recommend you to explore the official gRPC documentation and consider specific tutorials or courses to get a practical understanding of the framework.
