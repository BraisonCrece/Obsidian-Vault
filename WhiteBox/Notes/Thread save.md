**thread safety** is an important consideration in the design of software that runs in a <span style='color:#3867d6'>multithreaded environment</span>. **A program or routine is thread-safe if it can be called simultaneously from multiple threads without causing problems or inconsistencies**.

In the case of [[Flip-Flop ]], thread safety is important because Rails is a multi-threaded environment, which means that there can be multiple threads in your Rails application running simultaneously. Each thread may be checking or changing the state of the Flipflop features.

If Flipflop were not thread-safe, you could end up with race conditions, where the outcome depends on the relative order in which the threads execute their code. For example, one thread might be in the middle of checking the state of a feature when another thread changes that state, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

To avoid these problems, Flipflop is designed to be thread-safe. This means that you can use Flipflop in your Rails application without having to worry about race conditions or inter-thread synchronization issues.
