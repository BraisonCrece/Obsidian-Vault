## Definitions

### Ruby Gem

In Ruby, a Gem is a package of code that can be used to extend your application's functionality. Gems can provide features that range from simple tasks such as date and time formatting to more complex tasks like user authentication handling or CSV file handling. Gems are essentially Ruby code libraries that allow you to leverage code that has already been written by other developers to solve common problems.

### Rails Engine

A Rails Engine is a specialized form of Gem designed for use with the Ruby on Rails framework. An Engine is like a mini-application that can be mounted within another Rails application. It can have its own models, views, controllers, generators, rake tasks, and even routes. This allows for great code reuse because you can have common functionality encapsulated in an Engine and then mount that Engine in several Rails applications.

## Comparison

Now let's make a comparison between Gems and Rails Engines:

|  | Ruby Gem | Rails Engine |
|---|---|---|
| **Pros** | 1. Easy to use and setup. <br> 2. Allows for code reuse across any Ruby application. <br> 3. Widely used and supported by the Ruby community. <br> 4. Code is modular and encapsulated, making it easy to maintain and upgrade. | 1. Allows for reusing not just code, but also views, models, controllers, routes, etc. <br> 2. Allows for sharing functionality across Rails applications. <br> 3. Provides an isolated namespace so that code does not interfere with the main application. <br> 4. Can be mounted anywhere within a Rails application. |
| **Cons** | 1. Can only provide code-level functionality. <br> 2. Cannot be mounted as a standalone application. <br> 3. Cannot provide views, routes, controllers, etc. | 1. More complex to setup and maintain than a simple gem. <br> 2. Specific to Ruby on Rails, cannot be used in pure Ruby applications. <br> 3. Can have conflicts with the main application if namespace is not properly managed. |

I hope this helps you better understand the difference between a gem and a Rails engine and when it might be more appropriate to use one over the other.
